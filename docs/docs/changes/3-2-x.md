## 3.2.28
- The [Configuration Window](../configuration-window.md) has had the following updates:
    * The text style automatically tracks the dark/light mode settings from the `foobar2000` `Preferences`. Using custom colours is still supported by changing the mode via the `Style` button.
    * Using ++ctrl++ and the mouse wheel has always zoomed the text size but the setting was never saved. Now it is.
    * The zoom can be reset using ++ctrl+'0'++.
- `utils.TextBox` has beed updated to support coloured emoji.
- Fix `Thumbs` sample so automatic downloads work on radio streams. Existing users will need to re-import the sample using the `Samples` button in the [Configuration Window](../configuration-window.md).

## 3.2.27
- Various sample fixes.

## 3.2.26
- Fix bug with `IMetadbHandle` `GetFileInfo` not always returning a valid object.
- Various sample fixes.

## 3.2.25
- The default context menu has been updated with a `Clear properties` item. It's just a quicker alternative to opening the `Properties` dialog and using the `Clear` button.

## 3.2.24
- Fix various `Smooth` sample bugs when using the ++ctrl++ key and mouse wheel to increase the font size.

## 3.2.23
- The `Spectrogram Seekbar` samples now support cue sheets.

## 3.2.22

## 3.2.20
- Add [utils.DownloadImageAsync](../namespaces/utils.md#utilsdownloadimageasyncwindow_id-url) and [on_download_image_done](../callbacks/component.md#on_download_image_doneurl-image). Using these in combination allows the download/display of images in memory without the need for saving to file. Use `utils.DownloadFileAsync` if you want a permanent copy.

## 3.2.19
- In the [Configuration Window](../configuration-window.md), selected text now populates the `Find` field when you open the search dialog.
- The edit controls in `utils.InputBox` and `utils.TextBox` now support keyboard shortcuts like ++ctrl+back++ and ++ctrl+del++ for deleting whole words.

## 3.2.18
- `utils.MessageBox` and other prompts have been updated to support `Dark Mode`.
- You can now edit the sort pattern for `Smooth Browser` via the right click menu. Previously, it was only possible via the `Properties` window.

## 3.2.17
- 2 new button scripts have been added:
    * `Playback Buttons` which is a super minimal set for compact layouts.
    * `Track Info + Seekbar + Buttons + Volume` is a modification of an existing script adding a `Volume` slider.
- The existing `Track Info + Seekbar + Buttons` scripts have been updated so you can toggle the `Stop After Current` state by right clicking the `Stop` button. The new scripts also support this.

## 3.2.16
- The ability to be added as a `Columns UI` toolbar has been restored. Unlike previous versions, some sensible changes have been made:
    * There is no transparency option. It's enabled automatically.
    * It has its own default script which is a fully functional flyout menu.
    * Unlike normal `Columns UI` panels, `Edge Style` is not an option.
- Fix bug introduced in `3.2.15` where tooltips may not have updated correctly when toggling `Dark Mode`.
- The `Track Info + Seekbar + Buttons` have been updated to provide an alternative button set if the `Segoe Fluent Icons` font is installed. `Windows 11`
users have it by default, `Windows 10` users can download it [here](https://download.microsoft.com/download/8/f/c/8fc7cbc3-177e-4a22-af48-2a85e1c5bffb/Segoe-Fluent-Icons.zip).
This is a change from the attempt at using `Segoe MDL2 Assets` in the previous release which was problematic. Existing users need to use the `Samples` button to
reload the script and take advantage of it.

## 3.2.15
- Big internal rewrite of how `foobar2000` callbacks are forwarded to panels. Please report any issues if you encounter them.
- The `Track Info + Seekbar + Buttons` samples have a new button set available. Existing users must re-import using the `Samples` button in the [Configuration Window](../configuration-window.md). The new set is only available on `Windows 10` or later because it uses the `Segoe MDL2 Assets` font. The option will be greyed out on earlier versions of `Windows`. Use the right click menu to choose:

## 3.2.6
- Minor `IThemeManager` bug fix.
- `JS Playlist` has had support for collapsable group headers removed. See this [forum post](https://hydrogenaud.io/index.php/topic,110499.msg1023519.html#msg1023519) if you want to preserve this functionality by downloading a standalone copy.
- The playlist manager built in to `JS Playlist` and `Smooth Playlist Manager` now expose the `foobar2000` context menu for playlist content.
- The `Spectrogram Seekbar` scripts can now generate images for tracks longer than 1 hour in length. This requires [ffmpeg 6.0](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds.md#release-builds).

## 3.2.5
- Prevent component from loading on unsupported versions of `foobar2000`.
- Add [plman.GetQueryItems](../namespaces/plman.md#plmangetqueryitemsplaylistindex-query).

- Various sample fixes.

## 3.2.1
- The `Thumbs` sample has been limited to loading no more than 64MB of images from disk.

## 3.2.0
- The minimum requirement for [foobar2000](https://www.foobar2000.org) is now `2.0 Beta 18`.
- `utils.CheckComponent` has been removed and replaced with `fb.CheckComponent`.
- Changes to how [Smooth Playlist](../../gallery/smooth-playlist.md#clickable-ratings) and [JS Playlist](../../gallery/jsplaylist.md#clickable-ratings)
ratings were handled in `3.1.0` have been reverted. This is because of changes in `foobar2000`
`2.0 Beta 18`. Built-in `Playback Statistics` have been dropped and using `foo_playcount`
is once again needed if you want to apply/display ratings without tagging your files.
