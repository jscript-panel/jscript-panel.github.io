## 3.4.34
- Restore `utils.LoadSVG` after discovering it could be made to work with `Windows 7/8.1`.

## 3.4.33
- ~~Remove `utils.LoadSVG` because it blocked the component from loading on `Windows 7/8.1`. Apologies for not noticing this sooner.~~

## 3.4.32
- Fix crash bug introduced in `3.4.31`. While applying the latest fixes, code that required `foobar2000` `2.0` was accidentally included.

## 3.4.31
- Restore support for `Windows 7/8`. `Windows 7/8` users upgrading from `3.3.x` or earlier may need to use the `Samples` button to update if they encounter script errors. This font is also required: [Segoe Fluent Icons](https://download.microsoft.com/download/8/f/c/8fc7cbc3-177e-4a22-af48-2a85e1c5bffb/Segoe-Fluent-Icons.zip).
- For `Windows 7` compatibility, [utils.RemoveFolderRecursive](../namespaces/utils.md#utilsremovefolderrecursivepath-option) had to be removed.

## 3.4.30
- Fix bug when using `window.Reload()` from inside the `on_mouse_rbtn_up` callback.
- Fix issue introduced in `3.4.20` where main menu items created as keyboard shortcuts only (never displayed) were not executed by `fb.RunMainMenuCommand`.
- Fix `Smooth Playlist Manager` bug where it didn't auto scroll to the active playlist on startup.

## 3.4.29
- The following `plman` methods used to return a `boolean` value to indicate success but they have now been updated to not return any value.
```
plman.ExecutePlaylistDefaultAction
plman.MovePlaylist
plman.MovePlaylistSelection
plman.MovePlaylistSelectionV2
plman.RemovePlaylist
plman.RemovePlaylists
plman.RemovePlaylistSwitch
plman.ReplacePlaylistItem
plman.ShowAutoPlaylistUI
plman.ShowPlaylistLockUI
plman.SortByFormat
plman.SortByFormatV2
```
Most already have `playlistIndex` checks in place to throw script errors if they are invalid. The correct thing to do in most instances is to check playlist lock status before attempting any action. There are functions in [helpers.txt](https://github.com/jscript-panel/component/blob/db6e45548b6e2014ac26654d006bdc31fa5224f5/helpers.txt#L316-L338) to assist with this.

## 3.4.28
- Add `fb.VersionString` property. Provides the same string as `%_foobar2000_version%` but has `[x86]` or `[x64]` appended if using [foobar2000](https://www.foobar2000.org) `2.0` or later.
- The `Status Bar` sample has been updated to display the above version string when playback is stopped. Existing users will need to re-import using the `Samples` button.

## 3.4.27
- Improve `Smooth Browser` multi-select with ++shift++ key support.

- Various other `Smooth` fixes.

- [plman.SelectQueryItems](../namespaces/plman.md#plmanselectqueryitemsplaylistindex-query) now returns an array of the selected indexes.

- Add new [Play Log](../../gallery/play-log.md) sample.

## 3.4.20

## 3.4.19
- `Smooth Browser` has been updated so `Albums` are now sorted in alphabetical order and tracks without `%album%` tags are shunted to the end of the list. They are grouped by `%directory%`.

## 3.4.18
- Add [IMetadbHandleList AttachImage2](../interfaces/IMetadbHandleList.md#attachimage2image-art_id-format). This method allows attaching images from memory rather than file path.
- Update `Smooth Browser` group settings so the full `%date%` is displayed in `Album` mode.

## 3.4.17
- Add new `Menu + Playback Buttons + Custom Colours` sample. This is mainly for `Columns UI` because you cannot hide the menu toolbar in `Default UI`.
- Various `Status Bar` fixes and improvements. Existing users will need to re-import using the `Samples` button. Title formatting can now be configured via the right click menu and `$rgb` is supported.

## 3.4.16
- Update `Scintilla` library used for code highlighting. The last release may have had a bug related to undo/redo.

- Various other playlist fixes.

- Fix bug with original `Text Display` where the fonts/rgb internet link was broken.
- Fix bug with `Minimal Seekbar` where the seekbar knob overlapped the length text at the end of a track. Existing users will need to re-import using the `Samples` button.

## 3.4.12
- Add [IMetadbHandleList Reverse](../interfaces/IMetadbHandleList.md#reverse).
- Add `Playback Order` button to the following scripts. The original `Playback Buttons` has been left untouched.
```
Playback Buttons + Playback Order
Track Info + Seekbar + Buttons
Track Info + Seekbar + Buttons + Volume
Track Info + Spectrogram Seekbar + Buttons
```
Existing users will need to re-import using the `Samples` button. If it's not immediately obvious which mode each icon represents, tooltips give the full name.

## 3.4.11
- Fix bad change to `helpers.txt` in `3.4.8` which caused 3rd party scripts to break. Apologies for the inconvenience.

## 3.4.10
- Various internal improvements.

## 3.4.8
~~- Internal font handling changes which may help debugging in future.~~

## 3.4.7
- `FontAwesome` is no longer required. `Segoe Fluent Icons` is now used across all included samples. `Windows 11` users will already have this installed. Everyone else can get it [here](https://download.microsoft.com/download/8/f/c/8fc7cbc3-177e-4a22-af48-2a85e1c5bffb/Segoe-Fluent-Icons.zip).
- For existing users of any included button scripts, the following will need re-importing from the `Samples` button:
```
Playback Buttons
Track Info + Seekbar + Buttons
Track Info + Seekbar + Buttons + Volume
Track Info + Spectrogram Seekbar + Buttons
```

## 3.4.6
- ~~Transparency is now reserved exclusively for genuine `Columns UI` toolbars. Adding as a `Toolbar` via the `Columns UI` `Layout` settings will have no effect and it will be a normal panel with a solid colour background.~~ Reverted in `3.4.10`.
- Add new `Minimal Seekbar`. It's just a seekbar with playback time/length and no buttons. It's `Dark Mode` aware and will update itself when toggled.
- Fix bug with `Status Bar` sample.

## 3.4.5
- Add workaround for strange menu manager bug.

## 3.4.4
- `$jsp3_since` has been updated with proper `Today` / `Yesterday` handling and never returns `0d` any more.
- Minor sample fixes.

## 3.4.3
- `fb.AcquireSelectionHolder` and the `ISelectionHolder` interface have been removed due to bugs affecting other components. Their replacement
is the 3 `ISelectionHolder` methods being moved to [window](../namespaces/window.md). See how the included samples were updated [here](https://github.com/jscript-panel/component/commit/f4d4175d39f33da15450db8080bfd77118fa86a6).
- Add [utils.Now](../namespaces/utils.md#utilsnow).

## 3.4.2
- Fix [Configuration Window](../configuration-window.md) editor regression in `3.4.1`.

## 3.4.1
- Remove the `want_stub` argument from `IMetadbHandle` `GetAlbumArtAsync`. It was marked as deprecated in `3.3.10` and was meant to be removed in `3.4.0` but I forgot. See [fb.GetAlbumArtStub](../namespaces/fb.md#fbgetalbumartstubart_id).

## 3.4.0
- This release drops support for `Windows 7/8`. `Windows 8.1` is the new minimum requirement.
!!! note
	Support for `Windows 7/8` was restored in `3.4.31`.
- `window.IsThemed`, `window.CreateThemeManager` and the `IThemeManager` interface have all been removed.
- `IJSGraphics` `FillGradientRectangle` and `FillGradientRectangleAdvanced` have been removed. The standard `FillRectangle` and all other Draw/Fill methods now support [gradients](../guides/gradients.md).
- The `Edge Style` option has been removed for `Columns UI` panels.
- Existing `Text Display` users will need to re-import using the `Samples` button in the [Configuration Window](../configuration-window.md).
    * It now supports `%jsp3_playlist_name%` for displaying the playing/active playlist depending on selection settings. Note the playing track doesn't have to belong to a playlist so use of `$if` or `[]` is recommended.
    * When in `text only` mode, the margin can be configured from the right click menu. Also, the default value is reduced.
    * The [Gallery](../../gallery/text-display.md#title-formatting) page has been updated with more notes on exclusive title formatting features only available in this component.
