!!! note
	Component version `3.5.0` and later require at least `foobar2000` `2.1` and `Windows 10`.

## 3.5.7
- Fix `Last.fm Bio + Images` script error when there are no images to display. It was a regression in `3.5.6`.
- Update `Thumbs` sample so the brightness of the blurred background can be changed. Hold ++shift++ and scroll your mouse wheel to adjust.

## 3.5.6
- `%fb2k_profile_path%` was previously exclusive to the [Preprocessor](../preprocessors.md) section but now it's available in all [ITitleFormat](../interfaces/ITitleFormat.md) methods. Included samples like `Thumbs` and `Text Reader` can make use of it.
- `Thumbs` has been updated to blur the current image in the background if the `Centre` option has been selected.
- The above change to `Thumbs` means existing users of `Last.fm Bio + Images` must update using the `Samples` button in the [Configuration Window](../configuration-window.md).

## 3.5.5
- Update [ITitleFormat EvalPlaylistItem](../interfaces/ITitleFormat.md#evalplaylistitemplaylistindex-playlistitemindex)
and [ITitleFormat EvalActivePlaylistItem](../interfaces/ITitleFormat.md#evalactiveplaylistitemplaylistitemindex)
to return an empty string if supplied with invalid playlist/item indexes. Previously they would return `NEIN`
which is a quirk of the `foobar2000` `SDK`.

## 3.5.4
- Add `fb.CustomVolume` for compatibility with `UPnP` output devices. See the note [here](../namespaces/fb.md).
- Update `fb.Volume` to suppress errors if a `UPnP` device is active.
- Update the following samples with `$rgb` support:
```
Track Info + Seekbar + Buttons + Volume
Track Info + Seekbar + Buttons
Track Info + Spectrogram Seekbar + Buttons
```
Existing users will need to re-import using the `Samples` button in the [Configuration Window](../configuration-window.md).
- Reduce height of `utils.TextBox` (used by `Text Display`) so it works on a `1080p` display at `150%` `DPI`.

## 3.5.3
- Fix bug when using `window.Reload()` from inside the `on_mouse_rbtn_up` callback.

## 3.5.2
- Fix issue introduced in `3.4.20` where main menu items created as keyboard shortcuts only (never displayed)
were not executed by `fb.RunMainMenuCommand`.
- Fix `Smooth Playlist Manager` bug where it didn't auto scroll to the active playlist on startup.

## 3.5.1
- Add [fb.IsLibraryInitialised](../namespaces/fb.md#fbislibraryinitialised).
- Add [on_library_initialised](../callbacks/foobar2000.md#on_library_initialised) callback.

## 3.5.0
- The new minimum requirement for `foobar2000` is now `2.1`. `Windows 10` or later is also required.
- `fb.IsV2` has been removed. As it was a property, script errors will not be thrown if used but it will always be
`undefined`.
- The [IMetadbHandle GetFileInfo](../interfaces/IMetadbHandle.md#getfileinfo) method no longer accepts a `full_info`
parameter. It was previously required for `foobar2000` `1.x` users but full info is always returned in
`foobar2000` `2.x`.
- Update `Spectrogram Seekbar` samples to skip certain file types which `ffmpeg` tries to process but uses excessive
amounts of memory leading to possible crashes.
- Fix `JS Playlist` drag/drop bug.
