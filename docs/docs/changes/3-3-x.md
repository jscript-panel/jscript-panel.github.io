## 3.3.40
- Adding [utils.RemoveFolderRecursive](../namespaces/utils.md#utilsremovefolderrecursivepath-option) in `3.3.35` accidentially broke `Windows 7` support so it has been temporarily removed in this release. But that makes this the last version compatible with `Windows 7`.

## 3.3.39
- This reverts the rendering rewrite in `3.3.30`. It has been buggy for a few users when used in tab stacks.

## 3.3.38
- Add date display to `Album` mode in `Smooth Browser`. It's not available with the `Overlayed text` style but is for all others.

## 3.3.37
- Fix `$jsp3_since` bug introduced in `3.3.36`.

## 3.3.36
- Minor improvement to the formatting of strings returned by `$jsp3_since` added in `3.3.35`.

## 3.3.35
- Add [utils.RemoveFolderRecursive](../namespaces/utils.md#utilsremovefolderrecursivepath-option).
- Add `$jsp3_since` title format function. Supply it with a date string in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` format and you'll get a return value like `44wk 2d`. If the difference is less than 24 hours, it will return `0d`.
  This is not available globally, only in `JScript Panel 3`. For people not creating their own scripts, it can be used in `JS Playlist` custom columns or in `Text Display`.

## 3.3.34
- Add [plman.GetPlaybackOrders](../namespaces/plman.md#plmangetplaybackorders).
- [utils.LoadImage](../namespaces/utils.md#utilsloadimagepath-max_size) has been updated with an optional `max_size` option. The default is `0` which returns the original untouched. If the original image is smaller than a specified `max_size`, it will be returned untouched.
- `Thumbs` now defaults to a `max_size` of `1024px` for the main image but this can be changed via the right click menu options.

## 3.3.33
- Fix another `window.RepaintRect` bug introduced in `3.3.30`.

## 3.3.32
- Fix `Smooth Playlist` bug where clicking in a certain spot in the group header would cause a script error.
- Internal code cleanup.

## 3.3.31
- Fix `window.Repaint` / `window.RepaintRect` bugs introduced in `3.3.30`.

## 3.3.30
- The graphics rendering system has been rewritten.

## 3.3.29
- Update [utils.ReplaceIllegalChars](../namespaces/utils.md#utilsreplaceillegalcharsstr-modern-strip_trailing_periods) with an optional `strip_trailing_periods` argument. Set to `true` for folder names.
- Update `utils.Glob`, `utils.ListFiles` and `utils.ListFolders` to sort numerically like `Windows Explorer`.

	=== "Old behaviour"
		```
		E:\Pictures\1.jpg
		E:\Pictures\10.jpg
		E:\Pictures\2.jpg
		E:\Pictures\3.jpg
		```

	=== "New behaviour"
		```
		E:\Pictures\1.jpg
		E:\Pictures\2.jpg
		E:\Pictures\3.jpg
		E:\Pictures\10.jpg
		```

- Update `Thumbs` sample to use a multi-line edit box in `Custom folder` mode. Now you can specify multiple folders, one per line.

## 3.3.27
- Add [plman.ReplacePlaylistItem](../namespaces/plman.md#plmanreplaceplaylistitemplaylistindex-playlistitemindex-handle).

## 3.3.26
- `Last.fm Bio + Images` and `Thumbs (last.fm mode)` can now display the artist `stub` image from the main `Album Art` `Preferences` when no images are found.
- `Last.fm Bio + Images` and `Allmusic Review + Album Art` have been updated so they always display white text on dark background when no image is present. Existing users will need to re-import using the `Samples` button in the [Configuration Window](../configuration-window.md).
- `JS Playlist` has had the wallpaper opacity settings removed. It was unusable on higher settings so a low default is now used.

## 3.3.25
- `Last.fm Bio` bug fixes.

## 3.3.24
- A breaking change has been made to `utils.HTTPRequestAsync` but it only affects script authors making their own `POST` requests. See the updated docs [here](../namespaces/utils.md#utilshttprequestasyncwindow_id-type-url-user_agent_or_headers-post_data).
- `on_http_request_done` now receives `status` and `response_headers` arguments. See [here](../callbacks/component.md#on_http_request_donetask_id-success-response_text-status-response_headers).

## 3.3.23
- Rewrite `utils.HTTPRequestAsync` to use a 3rd party library instead of the `foobar2000` `SDK`.

- Both the above scripts have new options where you can toggle the layout orientation by right clicking the image. The ratio of image/text display can be changed by holding ++ctrl++ while scrolling the mouse wheel.

## 3.3.19
- Add [utils.GetCountryFlag](../namespaces/utils.md#utilsgetcountryflagcountry_or_code) and `$country_flag` title format function. How to use them is described on this [page](../guides/country-flags.md).

Details [here](../guides/styling-ranges-text.md). The `WriteTextStyles` basic sample has been updated to be compliant.
