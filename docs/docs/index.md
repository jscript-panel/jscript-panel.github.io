	On the 31st August 2024, it was noticed that the Last.fm API key supplied with JScript Panel for many years
	has been blocked for excessive usage. Component version `3.7.3` and later have a right click menu option
	for setting your own. You can get one from this link:

## Required fonts
For most samples, [Segoe Fluent Icons](https://download.microsoft.com/download/8/f/c/8fc7cbc3-177e-4a22-af48-2a85e1c5bffb/Segoe-Fluent-Icons.zip) is absolutely required. `Windows 11` users will already have this installed.

To display [Country Flags](./guides/country-flags.md), you should install the [Twemoji Mozilla](https://github.com/mozilla/twemoji-colr/releases/latest) font. Other fonts may not work as expected.

## Installation

It is assumed you know how to add panels to your layout. Basic guides
can be found below.

## Samples
Since the learning curve for writing your own scripts is quite steep, there
are many included samples that don't require any knowledge at all. You
can simply pick the one you want to use from the `Samples` button in
the [Configuration Window](configuration-window.md).

The [Gallery](../gallery/index.md) has recently been updated with more detailed
setup notes / usage instructions.
